/** A datastore is a simple, syncable database for app data. You can open the default datastore
 using <openDefaultStoreForAccount:error:> and open or create other datastores using a
 <DBDatastoreManager>.
 <!-- paragraph separator in class docs for appledoc bug -->
 You interact with data in the datastore using tables. You can call <getTable:> to get a table,
 or [getTables:](#DBDatastore.getTables:) to list all tables in a datastore containing
 records.
 <!-- paragraph separator in class docs for appledoc bug -->
 Changes you make to the datastore will be visible immediately, and calling <sync:> will persist
 outgoing changes and queue them to be uploaded to the server. While a datastore is open, it will
 monitor for remote changes and download them when possible. When there are remote changes waiting
 to be incorporated, the <DBDatastoreStatus> will have its `incoming` property set to `YES`, and calling
 <sync:> will also apply those changes to your view of the datastore, resolving any conflicts along
 the way.
 <!-- paragraph separator in class docs for appledoc bug -->
 To find out when there are changes ready to be synced, add an observer using <addObserver:block:>
 to register a block that will be called every time <status> changes. */

 Datastore IDs come in 2 forms:
 
 Named datastores (such as the default datastore) use IDs which
 can be 1-64 characters long, must not begin or end with a '.', and may contain lower-case
 letters, digits, and these punctuation characters: . - _  (Note that older SDKs limited these
 to 32 characters, so take care if your datastore needs to be accessed by legacy clients.)

 begin with a '.' and can contain 1-63 additional characters which can be upper-case, lower-case,
